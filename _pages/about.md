Research Experience
======
<font size=5>1. Metadynamics with Machine Learning Potentials</font>   
  * *Summer internship at University of Saskachewan, Saskatoon, Canada*      
  * Supervisor : Prof. Yansun Yao
  * July.2023---Present
  * I have attempted to use machine learning molecular dynamics potentials for Metadynamics simulations to study phase transitions. In comparison to traditional molecular dynamics, this method allows for simulations at a larger scale (around 500,000 atoms). I have already conducted benchmarks on Si and GaN. We hope that it can address the phase transition process of compressing onion carbon into diamond.

<font size=5>2. One-dimensional Ferroelectric</font>   
  * *Research Assistant at Westlake University, Hangzhou, China*      
  * Supervisor : Prof. Shi Liu
  * Dec.2022---Present
  * I employed density functional theory (DFT) to obtain a family of stable 1D nanothreads from cutting III-V two-dimensional triatomic layers anti-ferroelectric materials. This is the first predicted stable one-dimensional anti-ferroelectric and ferroelectric structure. These nanothreads exhibit anti-ferroelectric phases, along with radial polarization. The radial polarization can be reversed under the influence of an electric field. This discovery holds significant promise for memory applications, marking a breakthrough in the field of low-dimensional anti-ferroelectrics. The results will be submitted in the form of a research paper.

<font size=5>3. Ideal Strength Calculation Software</font>   
  * *Research Assistant at Jilin University, Changchun, China*      
  * Supervisor : Prof. Hanyu Liu
  * July.2022---May.2023
  * I have developed software for calculating the ideal strength of materials based on first-principles calculations, building upon the previous work of our research group. This software can compute the ideal strength of materials under arbitrary stress directions and supports simulations with different indenter shapes, such as simulating Vickers hardness. The source code has been uploaded to: [github](https://github.com/Zixun-Wang/MatElastPy)
The results are being submitted as a research paper, and a preprint version is available at: 
 [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01137)

<font size=5>4. Gain Mapping of Microstructure Gas Detectors (Micromegas)</font>   
  * *Research Assistant at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China*      
  * Supervisor : Prof. Ke Han
  * Jan.2021---Mar.2022
  * 1.Measurement of working gases for various components within the Micromegas device and Micromegas operation status at different flow rates.<br>
    2.Presentation of gain mapping under different operating conditions.
